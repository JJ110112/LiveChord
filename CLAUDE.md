# CLAUDE.md — LiveChord

Project-specific guidance for Claude Code working in this repo. Also see [doc/QA.md](doc/QA.md) for the full QA protocol.

## Environment

- **Dev repo**: `c:\Users\hitea\Claude\LiveChord` (git, source of truth)
- **Local testing**: IDE Live Server is installed, Playwright MCP is registered for AI-driven local QA.
- **Prod runtime** (NUC, mounted as `V:\` from PC): backend runs from `V:\backend`, frontend from `V:\frontend`
- **Backend server**: FastAPI/uvicorn, `main:app` on `0.0.0.0:8800` (see [backend/run.py](backend/run.py))
- **Production QA Server**: `http://192.168.50.6:8800/` (has been human tested)
- **Admin page**: `http://localhost:8800/admin`

## Deploy Sync (QA §590 防線5)

After any code change:
- Backend `.py` → copy to matching path under `V:\backend\`
- Frontend `.html`/`.js`/`.css` → copy to matching path under `V:\frontend\`
- Verify with `diff -q` after copy
- `W:\` is **not** the runtime — edits there are silent no-ops for the server

## UI QA (feedback_playwright_qa)

Any change to frontend files requires Playwright verification before claiming done:
- Uses Playwright MCP registered in IDE. AI should trigger playwright testing locally via Live Server or target URLs.
- Target `http://192.168.50.6:8800/` (v:\) if the feature is already deployed, as it has been human tested.
- Test the changed buttons / appearance / behaviour
- Cover edge cases (hard reload, no cache)
- Watch for regressions in unrelated features
- If the server isn't running and live QA is impossible, **say so explicitly** instead of claiming success

## Coding Rules

- **No `async def` for file I/O endpoints** — use plain `def` so FastAPI dispatches to the thread pool (see `feedback_async_def`)
- **Cache-busting**: bump `?v=N` on `<script>`/`<link>` tags when editing JS/CSS (QA UI rule 6)
- **BTC chord detection** runs in a `ProcessPoolExecutor` to isolate from the event loop GIL
